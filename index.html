    <h2 class="h2"> Football </h2>
    <p class ="p1"> Football has been my favourite sport to play ever since I watched Neymar in FCB. I have been playing football ever since I can remember and it has always been a big part of my life. I used to play as a defender for my high school team. From breaking my foot while playing to shouting at my favourite team for not attempting a humanly impossible goal, the chaos is why I love football.</p>

    <h2 class="hufc"> UFC </h2>
    <p class ="pufc"> Watching Youtube one day, I ended up stumbling upon a highlight reel of Conor McGregor. People hitting each other in creative ways was enough to get me hooked, and I soon found myself regularly following matchups and keeping up with the sport. I now aspire to learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu one day, hoping to understand and experience a part of the sport I have grown to admire.</p>

    <h2 class="hf1"> Formula 1 </h2>
    <p class ="pf1"> My friends actually introduced me to F1. The high-stakes racing and intense rivalries captivated me, leading me to follow the sport closely. Each race weekend, I tune in and closely follow the sport. The astounding amount of technology that is used to bring a F1 car to life is baffling and a part of my growing affection for the sport. Nevertheless, being a Ferrari fan, these weekends are tough on me.</p>

    <h2 class="hdj"> DJing </h2>
    <p class ="pdj"> DJing is a hobby I have recently started to explore. I absolutely love EDM music, Avicii being the undisputed greatest of all time in my opinion. I have recently started to experiment with DJing software such as Virtual DJ and Serato DJ Lite. While I am still a beginner, DJing is a really fun hobby to have. You can spend hours creating a tracklist and lose track of time. I am saving up to buy my first turntable so that I can work on this and someday perform at parties.</p>
