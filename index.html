    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p> My name is Sharwin Shah, and I am currently studying Computer Science (LM121) at the University of Limerick. I enjoy playing football, watching UFC, following Formula 1, and experimenting with DJing in my free time</p>

            <p>Reading has always been my favourite way to past time. From Diary of a Wimpy Kid to The Da Vinci Code, I love to indulge in all genres. My favourite though is Greek Mythology, to which I was introduced by the Percy Jackson book series.</p>

            <h2>Football</h2>

            <p>Watching Neymar inspired me to play football. Definitely not on the same skill level but its always a great time playing. Team practice is the most fun I had in high school. </p>

            <h2>Music Production (Beginner)</h2>
            <img src="https://happymag.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FL-Studio.jpg" alt="Music Production Image">
            <p>I recently started learning music production. Using FL Studios is a headache for the most part but when it finally all comes together, it's always worth the hassle. I am currently experimenting with house music and want to finish a project by Christmas</p>

            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <img src="https://pangolinphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Guest-with-camera-gear-on-safari-in-Botswana-Pangolin-Photo-Safaris-scaled.webp" alt="Photography Image">
            <p>Photography helps me capture the chaos of everyday life. I sometimes click pictures of random moments just so I could live these moments again through these pictures. </p>
